## Problems

1. Exercises 34.5-1<br>
The **subgraph-isomorphism problem** takes two undirected graphs **_G<sub>1</sub>_** and **_G<sub>2</sub>_**, and it asks whether **_G<sub>1</sub>_** is isomorphic to a subgraph of **_G<sub>2</sub>_**. Show that the subgraph-isomorphism problem is **NP-complete**.

2. Exercises 34.5-2<br>
Given an integer m x n matrix **_A_**, and an integer m-vector **_b_**, the **0-1 integer-programming problem** asks whether there exists an integer n-vector **_x_** with elements in the set _{0, 1}_ such that _Ax â‰¤ b_. Prove that 0-1 integer programming problem is **NP-complete**. (Hint: Reduce from **3-CNF-SAT**.)

3. Exercises 34.5-7<br>
The **longest-simple-cycle problem** is the problem of determining a simple cycle (no repeated vertices) of maximum length in a graph. Formulate a related decision problem, and show that the decision problem is **NP-complete**.

4. Assuming that the **maximum cut problem**(Given an unweighted simple graph **_G_** and an integer **_k_**, determine whether there is a cut of size at least **_k_** in **_G_**.) is **NP-Complete**, show that the **maximum set splitting problem**(Given a collection **_F_** of subsets of a finite set **_S_** and an integer **_k_**, decide whether there exists a partition of **_S_** into two subsets **_S<sub>1</sub>_**, **_S<sub>2</sub>_** such that at least **_k_** elements of **_F_** are split by this partition.) is **NP-Complete**.

5. Exercises 35.1-4<br>
Give an efficient greedy algorithm that finds an optimal vertex cover for a tree in linear time.
